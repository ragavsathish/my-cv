      \begin{itemize}     
        \item Responsible for enhancing and maintaining an open source data acquisition and analysis framework. It is a collaborative project between Schwartz Lab, Northwestern University and Ala-Laurila Lab, Aalto University
        \item Involved in assembling multi-electrode patch clamp system to quantify neural circuits
        \item Interfaced spatial stimulus (DLP projector) and built custom stimulus protocol for studying retinal circuits
        \item Developed calibration utility for both spatially uniform and structured stimulus sources (LED and DLP projector)
